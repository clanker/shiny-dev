Much of the following code is from Wickham's Mastering Shiny, Chapter 4.

```{r setup}
library(vroom)
library(tidyverse)
```

Download data and save in new `neiss` directory:
```{r load-data}
dir.create("neiss")
#> Warning in dir.create("neiss"): 'neiss' already exists
download <- function(name) {
  url <- "https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/raw/master/neiss/"
  download.file(paste0(url, name), paste0("neiss/", name), quiet = TRUE)
}
download("injuries.tsv.gz")
download("population.tsv")
download("products.tsv")
```

```{r}
(injuries <- vroom::vroom("neiss/injuries.tsv.gz"))
```

```{r}
(products <- vroom::vroom("neiss/products.tsv"))
(population <- vroom::vroom("neiss/population.tsv"))
```
